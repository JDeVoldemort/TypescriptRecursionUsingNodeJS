# Overview

I'm working on this typescript project to practice typescript and recursion. I'm using the typescript compiler to compile the typescript code into javascript code. I'm using the node.js runtime to run the javascript code.

The Software reads the contents of a directory and console.logs it to the console. It then recursively reads the contents of the subdirectories and console.logs them to the console.

My purpose in writing this software is to practice typescript and recursion.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used typscript, Node.js, and Visual Studio Code to develop this software.

I used typscript to write the code. I used node.js to run the code. I used Visual Studio Code to write the code. The fs module is a built-in node.js module that I used to read the contents of the directory. The path module is a built-in node.js module that I used to get the path of the directory.

# Future Work


- Add a feature to read the contents of a file.
- Add statistics for directories and files.
- Flush out more of the nodejs/typscript functionality.
